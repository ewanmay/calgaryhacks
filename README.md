Open two terminal tabs that will run the server and client respectively.

To build run the server:
```
cd server && npm i
npm start
```
The server runs on localhost:5000.

To build and run the client:
```
cd client && npm i
npm start
```
The client runs on localhost:3000.

## To play games with your friends
